## Application Test

Finally, we need to build a proof of concept for our new marketplace platform. We've put together a sample product list in the `products.json` file and we need your help to build a simple application.

For this test, you will need to add a simple UI so we can test the functionality of your backend.

Your requirements for this app:

1. Create a list page, which contains a list of the products sorted by date modified, and id.
2. Create a detail page, which shows more details about the the specific product.
3. Allow users to add new products or edit an existing product.
4. Use the json files as a "database" to read and write data changes. Abstract this read/write functionality from the main server functionality.
5. EXTRA: Use the users list to allow a "log in as" feature to record product "views". We don't require authentication, so a simple mechanism to change users is sufficient.
6. EXTRA: Recommend users to other products based on what their friends have "viewed". You may add additional dummy data to illustrate this functionality.

Complete steps 5 and 6 if time allows.


### Where to save your work

You can create the code on repl.it. However if you prefer to share a Github repo link, provide us access for our review.
